SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR POWERPOINT PDFs:
If the content appears to be from PowerPoint presentations and contains some garbled or encoded text, please:
1. Focus on the readable, clear text portions
2. Extract key concepts, definitions, and important points from the readable content
3. If you can identify slide breaks or sections, organize the content accordingly
4. Create a study guide that captures the educational value from the readable portions
5. If some content is unclear due to encoding issues, focus on the clear, educational content that is present
6. When content is limited, provide general study guidance for the subject area

Create a well-structured study guide that:
1. Extracts and organizes key concepts from the provided materials
2. Is appropriate for ${gradeLevel} students
3. Follows the ${format} format exactly
4. Is clear, concise, and easy to understand
5. Uses examples and information from the provided materials when available
6. Organizes information logically based on the source content
7. Focuses on the readable, educational content while acknowledging any limitations in the source material
