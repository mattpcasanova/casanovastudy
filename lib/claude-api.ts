TASK: Create a study guide using ONLY the content provided in the source materials. You may add analogies, explanations, and expansions to help clarify the provided content, but do not introduce new concepts, formulas, or information not mentioned in the provided PDFs.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. USE ONLY PROVIDED CONTENT: Base all content on concepts, terms, and information from the source materials
2. EXTRACT LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Find and organize content around learning objectives from the source material
3. NO EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE: Do not add new concepts, formulas, or examples not found in the provided PDFs
4. ALLOW CLARIFICATIONS: You may add analogies, explanations, and expansions to help explain the provided content
5. CREATE CLEAR HIERARCHY: Essential â†’ Important â†’ Supporting information (based on what's in the source)

COURSE MATERIALS TO ANALYZE:
${content}

STUDY GUIDE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES SECTION (Start Here)
   - Extract specific learning objectives from source material
   - If "Learning Intentions" or similar sections exist, prioritize these
   - Organize content around these objectives

2. CONTENT PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM (Based on Source Material)
   - ðŸ”´ ESSENTIAL: Key concepts, formulas, and definitions explicitly mentioned in the source materials
   - ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT: Examples, applications, and relationships described in the provided PDFs
   - ðŸŸ¢ SUPPORTING: Additional context and details found in the source materials

3. ACTIVE LEARNING ELEMENTS (Based on Source Content Only)
   - Questions: Create questions about concepts from the source materials (may include analogies to help explain)
   - Key Term Boxes: Highlight terms and definitions from the provided PDFs (may add clarifications and analogies)
   - Connection Points: "This relates to..." "Remember that..." "Compare with..."
   - Visual Cues: Use symbols, arrows, and formatting to show relationships

4. EXAM OPTIMIZATION
   - Focus on concepts students need to recall, not just understand
   - Include common exam question patterns
   - Highlight frequently tested relationships and formulas
   - Create comparison tables for contrasting concepts
   - Use process flowcharts for sequential concepts

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR POWERPOINT PDFs:
If the content appears to be from PowerPoint presentations and contains some garbled or encoded text, please:
1. Focus on the readable, clear text portions
2. Extract key concepts, definitions, and important points from the readable content
3. If you can identify slide breaks or sections, organize the content accordingly
4. Look specifically for learning objectives, bullet points, and key terms
5. Create a study guide that captures the educational value from the readable portions
6. When content is limited, provide general study guidance for the subject area

FORMATTING GUIDELINES:
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include visual separators between sections
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Highlight key terms in bold or with callout boxes
- Create tables for comparisons
- Use arrows and symbols to show relationships
- Include space for student notes

Create a study guide that:
1. Starts with clear learning objectives from the source material
2. Organizes content by priority (Essential â†’ Important â†’ Supporting)
3. Includes active learning elements throughout
4. Is optimized for exam preparation and retention
5. Uses visual cues and clear formatting
6. Focuses on what students need to know for exams
7. Is appropriate for ${gradeLevel} students
8. Follows the ${format} format exactly

IMPORTANT: Base all content on what is mentioned in the provided source materials. You may add analogies, explanations, and clarifications to help students understand the provided content, but do not introduce new concepts, formulas, or information not found in the PDFs. If a concept is not mentioned in the source materials, do not include it in the study guide.

Make sure the study guide is ready for students to use immediately for studying and review.`
