TASK: Create a study guide that prioritizes learning objectives and exam preparation. Work with whatever text was successfully extracted, even if incomplete.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. START WITH LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Extract and organize content around specific learning objectives from the source material
2. PRIORITIZE EXAM CONTENT: Focus on concepts that will definitely or likely be tested
3. ADD ACTIVE LEARNING: Include Quick Check questions, Key Term boxes, and Connection Points
4. CREATE CLEAR HIERARCHY: Essential â†’ Important â†’ Supporting information
5. OPTIMIZE FOR RETENTION: Use active recall and visual learning cues

SUBJECT: ${subject}
GRADE LEVEL: ${gradeLevel}
FORMAT: ${format}

COURSE MATERIALS TO ANALYZE:
${content}

STUDY GUIDE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES SECTION (Start Here)
   - Extract specific learning objectives from source material
   - If "Learning Intentions" or similar sections exist, prioritize these
   - Organize content around these objectives

2. CONTENT PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM
   - ðŸ”´ ESSENTIAL: Concepts that will definitely be on exam (formulas, key definitions, core processes)
   - ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT: Details likely to be tested (examples, applications, relationships)
   - ðŸŸ¢ SUPPORTING: Helpful context but not exam-critical (background info, extended examples)

3. ACTIVE LEARNING ELEMENTS (Include Throughout)
   - Quick Check Questions: "What is the formula for...?" "Explain the difference between..."
   - Key Term Boxes: Highlight definitions with clear, concise explanations
   - Connection Points: "This relates to..." "Remember that..." "Compare with..."
   - Visual Cues: Use symbols, arrows, and formatting to show relationships

4. EXAM OPTIMIZATION
   - Focus on concepts students need to recall, not just understand
   - Include common exam question patterns
   - Highlight frequently tested relationships and formulas
   - Create comparison tables for contrasting concepts
   - Use process flowcharts for sequential concepts

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR POWERPOINT PDFs:
If the content appears to be from PowerPoint presentations and contains some garbled or encoded text, please:
1. Focus on the readable, clear text portions
2. Extract key concepts, definitions, and important points from the readable content
3. If you can identify slide breaks or sections, organize the content accordingly
4. Look specifically for learning objectives, bullet points, and key terms
5. Create a study guide that captures the educational value from the readable portions
6. When content is limited, provide general study guidance for the subject area

FORMATTING GUIDELINES:
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include visual separators between sections
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Highlight key terms in bold or with callout boxes
- Create tables for comparisons
- Use arrows and symbols to show relationships
- Include space for student notes

Create a study guide that:
1. Starts with clear learning objectives from the source material
2. Organizes content by priority (Essential â†’ Important â†’ Supporting)
3. Includes active learning elements throughout
4. Is optimized for exam preparation and retention
5. Uses visual cues and clear formatting
6. Focuses on what students need to know for exams
7. Is appropriate for ${gradeLevel} students
8. Follows the ${format} format exactly

Make sure the study guide is ready for students to use immediately for studying and review.`
