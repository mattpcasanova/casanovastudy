TASK: Create a comprehensive study guide using STRICTLY AND EXCLUSIVELY the content provided in the source materials. You must work within the boundaries of the provided content only.

ABSOLUTE CONTENT RESTRICTIONS:
1. STRICT SOURCE-ONLY RULE: You may ONLY use concepts, terms, facts, and information explicitly mentioned in the provided source materials
2. NO EXTERNAL ADDITIONS: Do not add any concepts, formulas, or information from your general knowledge, even if related to the topic
3. NO TOPIC EXPANSION: Do not introduce broader subject areas or related topics not specifically covered in the source
4. CONTENT VERIFICATION: Before including any information, verify it appears in the provided source materials
5. ANALOGIES AND EXAMPLES ENCOURAGED: You may freely use analogies, examples, and explanations to help clarify and illustrate the provided content, as long as they serve to explain concepts that are already in the source materials

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
6. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE: Generate substantial content covering all major points from the source materials
7. BALANCED DISTRIBUTION: Ensure adequate content in each priority section (üî¥ ESSENTIAL, üü° IMPORTANT, üü¢ SUPPORTING)
8. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Generate the expected amount of content for the chosen format (flashcards: 10-15 cards, quiz: 8-12 questions)
9. COMPLETE UTILIZATION: Use all relevant information from the source materials, don't leave major concepts uncovered

MANDATORY STRUCTURE:
10. ALWAYS INCLUDE LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Create learning objectives based strictly on what the source materials cover
11. PRIORITY ORGANIZATION: Organize ALL content into üî¥ ESSENTIAL, üü° IMPORTANT, and üü¢ SUPPORTING sections
12. SOURCE-BASED HIERARCHY: Determine priority levels based on emphasis and coverage in the source materials

SUBJECT: ${subject}
GRADE LEVEL: ${gradeLevel}
FORMAT: ${format}
${topicFocus ? `TOPIC FOCUS: ${topicFocus}` : ''}
${difficultyLevel ? `DIFFICULTY LEVEL: ${difficultyLevel}` : ''}

${additionalInstructions ? `STYLE REQUIREMENTS: ${additionalInstructions}` : ''}

COURSE MATERIALS TO ANALYZE:
${content}

STUDY GUIDE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES SECTION (Always Required)
   - Create learning objectives based on the content provided
   - If "Learning Intentions" or similar sections exist, use those
   - If not explicitly stated, infer objectives from the content topics
   - Always include 3-5 clear, measurable learning objectives

2. CONTENT PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM (Always Required)
   - üî¥ ESSENTIAL: Core concepts, key definitions, and fundamental principles from the source materials
   - üü° IMPORTANT: Examples, applications, and practical relationships from the provided PDFs
   - üü¢ SUPPORTING: Additional context, background information, and extended details from the source materials
   - Always organize content into these three priority levels with clear section headers

3. ACTIVE LEARNING ELEMENTS (Based on Source Content Only)
   - Questions: Create questions about concepts from the source materials (may include analogies to help explain)
   - Key Term Boxes: Highlight terms and definitions from the provided PDFs (may add clarifications and analogies)
   - Connection Points: "This relates to..." "Remember that..." "Compare with..."
   - Visual Cues: Use symbols, arrows, and formatting to show relationships

4. EXAM OPTIMIZATION
   - Focus on concepts students need to recall, not just understand
   - Include common exam question patterns
   - Highlight frequently tested relationships and formulas
   - Create comparison tables for contrasting concepts
   - Use process flowcharts for sequential concepts

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR POWERPOINT PDFs:
If the content appears to be from PowerPoint presentations and contains some garbled or encoded text, please:
1. Focus on the readable, clear text portions
2. Extract key concepts, definitions, and important points from the readable content
3. If you can identify slide breaks or sections, organize the content accordingly
4. Look specifically for learning objectives, bullet points, and key terms
5. Create a study guide that captures the educational value from the readable portions
6. When content is limited, provide general study guidance for the subject area

FORMATTING GUIDELINES:
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include visual separators between sections
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Highlight key terms in bold or with callout boxes
- Create tables for comparisons
- Use arrows and symbols to show relationships
- Include space for student notes

Create a study guide that:
1. Starts with clear learning objectives from the source material
2. Organizes content by priority (Essential ‚Üí Important ‚Üí Supporting)
3. Includes active learning elements throughout
4. Is optimized for exam preparation and retention
5. Uses visual cues and clear formatting
6. Focuses on what students need to know for exams
7. Is appropriate for ${gradeLevel} students
8. Follows the ${format} format exactly

FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
Before finalizing your response, verify:
‚úì Every core concept, term, and fact comes directly from the provided source materials
‚úì No external knowledge, related topics, or broader subject areas have been added
‚úì All priority sections (üî¥ üü° üü¢) contain substantial, balanced content (minimum 3-4 items each)
‚úì The format requirements are met (flashcards: 12-15, quiz: 10-12 questions, etc.)
‚úì Learning objectives reflect only what the source materials cover (3-5 objectives)
‚úì Analogies and examples serve to clarify provided content, not introduce new concepts
‚úì All core information can be traced back to specific content in the provided materials
‚úì Content is appropriate for the specified grade level and difficulty
‚úì Questions progress logically from basic recall to application/analysis
‚úì Key terms are properly defined using only source material definitions

CONTENT BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT:
If the source materials are limited, work within those boundaries rather than expanding the topic. If a concept is not explicitly mentioned in the source materials, do not include it in the study guide, even if it seems related or important to the broader subject. However, feel free to use creative analogies, examples, and explanations to make the provided content more understandable and memorable for students.

Make sure the study guide is comprehensive within the source boundaries and ready for students to use immediately for studying and review.`

MC_QUESTION: Which factor most directly affects solubility?
A) The color of the solution
B) The temperature of the water
C) The volume of the container
D) The time of day

TF_QUESTION: Stirring increases the rate of dissolving but not the total amount that can dissolve.

SA_QUESTION: Explain what happens when salt dissolves in water.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use **bold** formatting around the prefixes. Use exactly MC_QUESTION:, TF_QUESTION:, SA_QUESTION: as plain text.
