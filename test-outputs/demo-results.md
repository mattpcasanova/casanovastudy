# AICE Marine Science: Water Solubility

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this study session, you will be able to:
1. Define solubility and explain how it relates to marine environments
2. Identify factors that affect the solubility of substances in water
3. Compare solubility of different types of compounds in aquatic systems
4. Analyze the relationship between temperature and solubility in marine contexts
5. Apply solubility concepts to real-world marine science scenarios

## Key Concepts

### What is Solubility?
Solubility is the ability of a substance (solute) to dissolve in a solvent (like water) to form a homogeneous solution. In marine science, this determines what substances can dissolve in seawater and in what concentrations.

### "Like Dissolves Like" Principle
This fundamental principle means that polar substances dissolve well in polar solvents (like water), while nonpolar substances dissolve well in nonpolar solvents. Since water is polar, polar and ionic compounds dissolve well in seawater.

### Temperature Effects
For most solid solutes, solubility increases with temperature. Warmer ocean water can hold more dissolved substances than colder water. However, for gases (like oxygen), solubility decreases as temperature increases.

### Factors Affecting Solubility
The primary factors are:
- Temperature
- Pressure  
- Nature of the solute and solvent (polar vs. nonpolar)
- Presence of other dissolved substances

## Marine Applications

### Oxygen Solubility in Ocean Waters
Gas solubility decreases with increasing temperature. This is why cold polar waters have higher dissolved oxygen concentrations than warm tropical waters, affecting marine life distribution.

### Pressure Effects in Deep Waters
According to Henry's Law, gas solubility increases with pressure. Deep ocean waters under high pressure can hold more dissolved gases than surface waters.

### Salt and Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds (like salts) and polar molecules are most soluble in seawater because water is a polar solvent. This explains why salts like sodium chloride dissolve readily in ocean water.

### Salting Out Effect
The high salt content in seawater can affect the solubility of other substances through the "salting out" effect, where dissolved salts can decrease the solubility of other compounds.

## Key Terms
- **Solubility**: The ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent
- **Solute**: The substance being dissolved
- **Solvent**: The substance doing the dissolving (water in marine contexts)
- **Polar**: Having an uneven distribution of electrical charge
- **Nonpolar**: Having an even distribution of electrical charge
- **Henry's Law**: Gas solubility is proportional to pressure
- **Salting out**: Decreased solubility due to high salt concentration
